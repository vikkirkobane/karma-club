## 🔧 Technical Details

### Activity Structure

```typescript
interface Activity {
  id: string;              // Auto-generated (e.g., "daily-7")
  title: string;           // Activity name
  description: string;     // Full description
  points: number;          // Points awarded (1-10)
  isCompleted: boolean;    // Completion status
  imageUrl?: string;       // Optional image
}
```

### Category Types

```typescript
enum ActivityType {
  DAILY = 'daily',
  VOLUNTEER = 'volunteer',
  ENGAGEMENT = 'engagement',
  SUPPORT = 'support'
}
```

### Point Guidelines

**Recommended points by category:**
- Daily Acts: 1 point
- Engagement: 2 points
- Support: 2 points
- Volunteerism: 3 points

*(Admins can customize these values 1-10)*

## 💾 Data Persistence

### Current Implementation (Development)
- Activities stored in **component state**
- Persists during session
- Resets on page refresh

### Production Implementation (Recommended)

**Option 1: Supabase Database**
```sql
CREATE TABLE activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (category IN ('daily', 'volunteer', 'engagement', 'support')),
  points INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (points >= 1 AND points <= 10),
  image_url TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
);
```

**Option 2: Local Storage**
```typescript
// Save to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('activities', JSON.stringify(activities));

// Load from localStorage
const savedActivities = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('activities') || '{}');
```

### Mobile Responsive
- Form fields stack vertically
- Stats cards in 2-column grid
- Activities list remains scrollable

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Admin-only UI access
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Component-level state management

### Production Recommendations

**1. Backend Validation**
```typescript
// API endpoint: POST /api/activities
app.post('/api/activities', async (req, res) => {
  // Verify user is admin
  const isAdmin = await checkAdminStatus(req.userId);
  if (!isAdmin) return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  
  // Validate input
  const { title, description, category, points } = req.body;
  if (!title || !description) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });
  }
  
  // Save to database
  const activity = await db.activities.create({...});
  return res.json(activity);
});
```

**2. Permission Checks**
```typescript
// In ActivityManagement component
const { user } = useAuth();

useEffect(() => {
  if (!user?.isAdmin) {
    navigate('/');
    toast({
      title: "Access Denied",
      description: "You don't have permission to access this page.",
      variant: "destructive"
    });
  }
}, [user]);
```
