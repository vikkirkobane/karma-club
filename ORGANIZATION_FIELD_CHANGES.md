## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### Form State Changes:
```typescript
// Before (SignupForm)
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  username: '',
  email: '',
  password: '',
  confirmPassword: '',
  country: '',
  countryCode: '',
  organization: ''  // REMOVED
});

// After (SignupForm)
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  username: '',
  email: '',
  password: '',
  confirmPassword: '',
  country: '',
  countryCode: '',
  // organization field removed
});
```

### Profile Settings Addition:
```typescript
// Added to Settings.tsx
<div>
  <Label htmlFor="organization">Organization (Optional)</Label>
  <Input
    id="organization"
    value={user.organization || ''}
    placeholder="Enter your organization"
    className="bg-gray-800 border-gray-700"
    onChange={(e) => updateUser({ organization: e.target.value })}
  />
</div>
```
