## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: "Upload Failed" Error**

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
```
‚ùå Upload preset doesn't exist
‚úÖ Create "karma-club-uploads" preset in Cloudinary

‚ùå Preset is set to "Signed" mode
‚úÖ Change to "Unsigned" mode in preset settings

‚ùå File size too large
‚úÖ Check file is under 10MB

‚ùå Unsupported file format  
‚úÖ Use JPG, PNG, or MP4 files
```

### **Issue 2: "Invalid Cloud Name" Error**

**Check Your Configuration:**
```javascript
// In browser console, check:
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME);
// Should output: "dyedachrz"

console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET);  
// Should output: "karma-club-uploads"
```

### **Issue 3: Files Upload but Don't Display**

**Check URL Format:**
- Uploaded URL should look like: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dyedachrz/image/upload/v1234567890/karma-club/submissions/filename.jpg`
- If URL is different, check your preset folder settings

### **Issue 4: CORS Errors**

**Solution:**
- Cloudinary should allow browser uploads by default
- If you see CORS errors, check your upload preset is set to "Unsigned"

## üìã **Environment Variables Verification**

**Your `.env` file should contain:**
```env
# Cloudinary Configuration (Client-side upload)
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dyedachrz
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=karma-club-uploads
```

**To verify they're loaded correctly:**
1. **Open browser developer tools**
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Run these commands:**
```javascript
// Check cloud name
console.log('Cloud Name:', import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME);

// Check preset  
console.log('Upload Preset:', import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET);
```

## üîí **Security Best Practices**

### **‚úÖ Current Setup (Good):**
- Using unsigned upload presets (client-safe)
