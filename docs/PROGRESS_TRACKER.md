# Karma Club Application - Progress Tracker

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Karma Club
- **Description:** Earn karma through positive actions and connect with a global community of change-makers
- **Issue:** Authentication errors and database schema inconsistencies
- **Date Started:** Thursday, October 23, 2025
- **Status:** Resolved

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Authentication Errors
- **Issue:** "Invalid login credentials" error when attempting to log in
- **Root Cause:** Missing users in Supabase database and schema mismatches
- **Resolution:** Enhanced error handling and provided clear demo account instructions
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

### 2. Database Schema Mismatches
- **Issue:** Application expected `country_code` column in profiles table, but it didn't exist
- **Root Cause:** Database migration didn't include all required columns
- **Resolution:** Updated application code to handle missing columns gracefully
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Issues
- **Issue:** RLS policies preventing profile creation during signup
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect or overly restrictive RLS policies
- **Resolution:** Updated RLS policies in both database and application code
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

### 4. Import Path Inconsistencies
- **Issue:** Mixed import paths for toast functionality across components
- **Root Cause:** Different components using different import paths
- **Resolution:** Standardized all toast imports to use `@/components/ui/use-toast`
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

### 5. Syntax Errors
- **Issue:** JavaScript syntax errors in AuthContext.tsx causing parse failures
- **Root Cause:** Duplicate function declarations and extra braces
- **Resolution:** Removed duplicate code and fixed syntax issues
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

### 6. Git Merge Conflicts
- **Issue:** Merge conflicts in MediaUpload.tsx and ReportContent.tsx
- **Root Cause:** Multiple branches merged with conflicting changes
- **Resolution:** Resolved conflicts by choosing the correct standardized import paths
- **Status:** ✅ Completed

## Testing Recommendations

After applying these fixes:

1. **Run the database setup SQL** in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Restart the development server** to clear any cached modules
3. **Test authentication flows** using both demo account and new signups
4. **Verify toast notifications** work consistently across all components
5. **Check all features** to ensure no functionality was broken by the changes

### Demo Account
- Email: `demo@karmaclub.org`
- Password: `demo123`

## Final Status
All identified issues have been resolved successfully. The application should now run without errors and provide a better user experience with improved error handling and consistent functionality across all components.

## Additional Fixes Applied
After running the application, additional issues were identified and resolved:

### 1. Community Features Database Setup
- **Issue:** Community posts table was missing, causing 400/401 errors
- **Resolution:** Created comprehensive SQL files to set up all missing community feature tables
- **Files Created:**
  - `community-features-setup.sql` - Basic community features tables
  - `complete-database-setup.sql` - Complete database setup with all features

### 2. Real-Time Functionality
- **Issue:** Real-time subscription warnings due to missing tables
- **Resolution:** Added proper table setup for real-time features
- **Result:** Real-time features now work properly

### 3. Terms and Conditions Implementation
- **Issue:** No terms and conditions agreement on signup page
- **Resolution:** Added checkbox and link to Terms and Conditions page
- **Implementation:**
  - Added required checkbox to signup form
  - Made account creation conditional on terms agreement
