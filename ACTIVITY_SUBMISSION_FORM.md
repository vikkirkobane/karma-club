# Activity Submission Form - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Activity Submission Form has been successfully implemented on the karma-club-full page. When users click the "Complete Activity" button, they can now submit:
- Title (required)
- Description (required) 
- Image or short video (optional)

## Features Implemented

### 1. Submission Form Dialog
- **Location**: `src/components/ActivitySubmissionForm.tsx`
- **Trigger**: Clicking "Complete Activity" button on karma-club-full page
- **Fields**:
  - Title (required text input)
  - Description (required textarea)
  - Media upload (optional image/video)

### 2. Media Upload Component
- **Location**: `src/components/MediaUpload.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Support for images and videos (up to 10MB)
  - Drag & drop functionality
  - File validation
  - Preview functionality
  - Upload to Cloudinary

### 3. Data Storage Integration
- **Text Fields**: Stored in Supabase `user_activities` table
  - `description` field stores the submission description
  - `activity_id` links to the completed activity
  - `user_id` identifies the submitting user
  - `completed_at` timestamp
- **Media Files**: Uploaded to Cloudinary
  - `media_url` field in `user_activities` table stores the Cloudinary URL

### 4. API Functions
- **Location**: `src/lib/api.ts`
- **Functions Added**:
  - `submitActivity()` - Saves submission to Supabase
  - `updateUserPoints()` - Awards points to user
- **Location**: `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`
- **Functions Enhanced**:
  - `uploadMedia()` - Uploads files to Cloudinary
  - Uses environment variables for configuration

## Database Schema

The existing `user_activities` table supports the submission data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_activities (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  activity_id INTEGER REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  media_url VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT
);
```

## Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Supabase (already configured)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Cloudinary (need to configure)
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name_here
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_cloudinary_upload_preset_here
```

## Usage Flow

1. **User Navigation**: User goes to `/karma-club-full` page
2. **Activity Selection**: User browses activities and clicks "Complete Activity"
3. **Form Opening**: ActivitySubmissionForm dialog opens
4. **Form Filling**: User fills required fields (title, description)
5. **Media Upload**: User optionally uploads image/video
6. **Submission**: 
   - Media file uploads to Cloudinary (if provided)
   - Submission data saves to Supabase
   - User receives points for completion
   - Success toast notification shows

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- `selectedActivity`: Tracks which activity is being submitted
- `isSubmissionFormOpen`: Controls dialog visibility
- `isSubmitting`: Prevents double-submission and shows loading state

### Error Handling
- File size validation (10MB limit)
- File type validation (images/videos only)
- Network error handling for uploads
- User feedback via toast notifications

### User Experience
- Required field validation
- Loading states during submission
- Progress indicators for media upload
- Success/error feedback
- Form reset after successful submission

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `src/pages/KarmaClub.tsx` - Added form integration and submission logic
2. `src/components/ActivitySubmissionForm.tsx` - Enhanced with better UX
3. `src/components/MediaUpload.tsx` - Fixed toast import
4. `src/lib/api.ts` - Added submission functions
5. `src/lib/cloudinary.ts` - Enhanced with environment variables

### Created Files:
1. `user_points_function.sql` - Database function for safe point updates
2. `ACTIVITY_SUBMISSION_FORM.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps

### Required Setup:
1. **Configure Cloudinary**:
   - Create Cloudinary account
   - Set up upload preset
   - Add credentials to `.env` file

2. **Database Function** (Optional but recommended):
   - Run `user_points_function.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This provides atomic point updates

### Optional Enhancements:
1. Add submission history view
2. Implement submission moderation
3. Add rich text editor for descriptions
4. Enable video thumbnails
5. Add submission sharing features

## Testing

The implementation has been built successfully and is ready for testing:

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/karma-club-full`
3. Click "Complete Activity" on any activity card
4. Test form submission with and without media

## Security Notes

- File uploads are validated for type and size
- Supabase RLS policies protect user data
- Cloudinary upload preset should be configured securely
- User authentication is required for submissions
