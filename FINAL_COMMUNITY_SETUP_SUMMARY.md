- Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Run the Script**

### **Step 3: Verify Success**
You should see:

```

## 🏗️ **What Gets Created**

```

### **⚡ Functions (4 total):**
```sql

```

### **🔒 Security:**
```sql

```

### **📈 Performance:**
```sql

```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Safe to run multiple times** - Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`
2. **Compatible with existing data** - Won't overwrite your current database
3. **Includes fallbacks** - App works gracefully even if setup isn't run
4. **Updated for 2025** - Community challenge dates are current

## 🔍 **Verification Checklist**

After running the script, verify in Supabase:

**Table Editor:**
- [ ] `community_posts` table exists
- [ ] `post_likes` table exists  
- [ ] `post_comments` table exists
- [ ] All tables have proper columns and relationships

**SQL Editor:**
- [ ] Run `SELECT * FROM community_stats;` returns data
- [ ] Run `SELECT toggle_post_like('test', 1);` executes without error

**Your App:**
- [ ] Navigate to `/community` 
- [ ] Create a test post
- [ ] Try liking a post
- [ ] Try adding a comment
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

## 🛟 **Troubleshooting**

**If you see errors:**
- **"already exists"** → Ignore, this is normal
- **"permission denied"** → Check you're logged into correct Supabase project
- **"relation does not exist"** → Make sure you ran the complete script

**If features don't work:**
- Refresh your browser page
- Check browser console for new error messages
- Verify tables exist in Supabase Table Editor
- Try running the script again (safe to re-run)

## 🎉 **Success!**

- ✅ **Real-time updates** across all users
